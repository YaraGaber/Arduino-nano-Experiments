## Introduction
The **Arduino Nano** is a compact and versatile microcontroller board that is perfect for prototyping and building small-scale projects. This repository contains a variety of experiments that showcase the capabilities of the Arduino Nano, including:
- Working with sensors (e.g., temperature, light, motion).
- Controlling actuators (e.g., LEDs, motors, servos).
- Communicating with other devices (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).

Each experiment is documented with a circuit diagram, code, and instructions to help you get started.
